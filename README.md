I'm an Italian student of Data Science at the University of Padua and I have a bachelor's degree in Statistics. ðŸ“ˆðŸ“Š <br />
My greatest passions are music business, music and live events, such as festivals, in which I like to take an active part. ðŸŽµðŸŽ§â€Š <br />
During my studies I did group work looking for projects that made me experiment with different types of data and different models to implement.
